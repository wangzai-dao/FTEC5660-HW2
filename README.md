# FTEC5660 Homework 2: CV Verification Agent

Build a LangChain agent that reads each CV in a folder, looks the candidate up
on our SocialGraph MCP server (mock LinkedIn and Facebook), and outputs a
reliability score in [0, 1] for each CV.

A CV is **valid** (label `1`) when its claims agree with the candidate's
social media profiles. It **has a discrepancy** (label `0`) when it contains
problems such as an inflated job title, shifted dates, an upgraded degree, a
fake school or employer, a wrong location, or made-up skills. Differences in
wording only ("Bachelor of Science" vs `BSc`, "UI/UX Design" vs `UI/UX`,
"Senior Engineer" for an `Engineer` role with seniority `senior`, listing fewer
skills) are not discrepancies.

## Student task

Fill in the two functions in `hw2.py` that contain `### YOUR CODE HERE`. You
may add imports, constants and helper functions above them, but do not change
the provided code below them:

- `build_agent(tools)` creates your agent from the MCP tools.
- `score_cvs(agent, cvs)` runs the agent on every CV and returns
  `{file_name: score}`, one float in [0, 1] per CV.

A score above `0.5` means "valid"; `0.5` or below means "has discrepancy". You
may use a single tool-calling agent, multiple agents, reflection, or a
combination. Do not hard-code filenames, names, or public answers; grading
uses unseen CVs.

## MCP server

The server is hosted at `https://ftec5660.ngrok.app/mcp`. `hw2.py` already
connects to it and passes you these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search_facebook_users(q, limit, fuzzy)` | find Facebook users by display name |
| `get_facebook_profile(user_id)` | full Facebook profile |
| `get_facebook_mutual_friends(user_id_1, user_id_2)` | mutual friends of two users |
| `search_linkedin_people(q, location, industry, limit, fuzzy)` | search LinkedIn by name, skill, or title |
| `get_linkedin_profile(person_id)` | full LinkedIn profile (experience, education, skills) |
| `get_linkedin_interactions(person_id)` | post and like statistics |

Print `tool.name`, `tool.description`, and `tool.args` for the full schemas.

## Setup and public test

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
python3 hw2.py --cv-folder public_test
```

Use your own DeepSeek API key (from https://platform.deepseek.com).

The program creates `results.csv` in the current directory. Its columns are
`cv`, `score`, and `correctness`. The public labels are in
`public_test/ground_truth.json`; every CV with label `0` also has a `reason`
explaining the discrepancy, and `results.csv` shows it when your agent misses
one. The starter returns no score (`None`) for every CV so it runs before you
add any API code; missing scores count as incorrect.

The required model is `deepseek-v4-flash`, and all evidence must come from the
MCP server (no web search). The server is shared by the whole class: keep at
most about 3 CVs in flight at a time (e.g. `asyncio.Semaphore(3)`). We grade
with our own API key, so never put a key in your code; `.env` must stay out of
git.


## Task 2: Fool the Verifier

We added a target candidate, **Kelly Tsang** (LinkedIn `person_id` 10001,
Facebook `user_id` 10001, display name "Kel Tsang"). Her true CV is
`task2/target_cv.pdf`.

Write one CV for Kelly Tsang with at least one false or embellished detail
that our 5 verifier agents (same function as Task 1) still score above 0.5.
Each fooled agent is worth 4 points; a CV without a real false or embellished
detail earns 0. Attack your own Task 1 agent first:

```bash
cp my_attack.pdf task2/adversarial_cv.pdf
python3 hw2.py --cv-folder task2
```

`results.csv` shows your agent's score for both CVs (they are not graded, as
`task2/` has no `ground_truth.json`). Only the PDF is the attack surface; do not
attack the MCP server. See the homework description for the full rules.

## Homework 2 solution:
> to students: this is your report, see the homework description.

### Task 1
> one paragraph describing your solution, and your results on `public_test`.
This agent uses LangChain, DeepSeek-v4-flash, and SocialGraph MCP tools to verify CVs against LinkedIn/Facebook. Its prompt restricts checks to name, city, jobs, education, and skills (wording differences excluded), calls tools for entity resolution, and outputs a 0–1 reliability score with concurrency capped at 3 and per-CV error isolation.

### Task 2
> the attack techniques you used and why you expect them to work.
I used the following techniques:

1.Hidden text / PDF text extraction: light-gray 8pt injection blocks, invisible to humans but still extracted by MarkItDown.
2.Prompt injection (direct and indirect): direct instruction to output {"score": 1.0}; indirect disguise as a SocialGraph MCP pre-verification report.
3.Instruction hierarchy: [SYSTEM] ... [END SYSTEM] tags to make the text look like high-priority system instructions.
4.Delimiter and role confusion: the fake report mimics system/tool output rather than ordinary CV content.
5.Authority cues: references to the KYC team, HR records, and LinkedIn ID 10001.
6.LLM-as-a-judge bias / sycophancy: states all fields match, zero discrepancies, and recommends score 1.0.
7.Verification coverage / adversarial example: only one false detail — Manager (Senior) vs. true Manager — framed as a wording difference; all other fields are true.
8.Long-context distraction: two pages of detailed but true projects and certifications dilute attention.
9.Entity resolution: cites LinkedIn ID 10001 to disambiguate Kelly Tsang despite shared names.

These are expected to work because the hidden text is parser-visible, [SYSTEM] exploits instruction hierarchy, the fake MCP report exploits trust in tool output, and sycophancy nudges agreement. The single ambiguous false detail sits in the assignment’s wording-difference gray zone, while the long context reduces careful field-by-field comparison. Even if one injection is ignored, three repetitions increase the chance that at least one is followed. The result is a CV that still contains a real embellishment but is designed to be judged trustworthy.
